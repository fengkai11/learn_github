1. fatal : the remote origin already exists ?

#delete the remote git repository the add the remote repository

git remote rm origin

2. error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:....." 
Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally. 
This is usually caused by another repository pushing to

git pull origin master
git push -u origin master
